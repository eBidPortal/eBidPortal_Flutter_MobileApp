🎯 Immediate Priorities (High Impact)
1. Auction Detail Screen ⭐ RECOMMENDED FIRST
Full auction details page
Image gallery/carousel
Bid history
Seller information
Place bid button
Add to watchlist
Share functionality
Why: Users can click auctions but have nowhere to go - this is critical UX


2. Bidding Functionality
Place bid API integration
Bid validation (increment rules)
Real-time bid updates
Bid confirmation dialog
Success/error handling
Why: Core feature of an auction platform


3. Watchlist Implementation
Add/remove from watchlist
Watchlist screen (currently placeholder)
API integration for saved auctions
Why: Essential for user engagement


📋 Phase 3 Options

Option C: Profile & Settings

🚀 My Recommendation
Start with Auction Detail Screen because:

It's the natural next step from the list
Users expect to tap an auction and see details
It's where bidding will happen
Completes the core user flow: Browse → View → Bid
